> what is PHP?

**PHP** is a **server-side scripting language** mainly used for **web development** but can also be used for general-purpose programming. Unlike **JavaScript**, which runs on the clientâ€™s browser, **PHP scripts execute on the server**, and the output is sent as **HTML** to the browser.  

Key Points:- 
- **Server-Side Execution:** Runs on the web server before sending content to the client.  
- **Dynamic Content:** Generates content based on script execution.  
- **File Extension:** PHP scripts are typically saved with the **.php** extension.  
- **Original Name:** Initially stood for "Personal Home Page," now **PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor** (recursive acronym).
