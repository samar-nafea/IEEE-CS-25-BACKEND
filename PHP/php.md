> what is PHP?

**PHP** is a **server-side scripting language** mainly used for **web development** but can also be used for general-purpose programming. Unlike **JavaScript**, which runs on the clientâ€™s browser, **PHP scripts execute on the server**, and the output is sent as **HTML** to the browser.  

Key Points:- 
- **Server-Side Execution:** Runs on the web server before sending content to the client.  
- **Dynamic Content:** Generates content based on script execution.  
- **File Extension:** PHP scripts are typically saved with the **.php** extension.  
- **Original Name:** Initially stood for "Personal Home Page," now **PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor** (recursive acronym).

> what are the three main error types in PHP?

**Three Main Error Types in PHP**  

1. **Parse Error (Syntax Error)**:-  
   - Occurs due to syntax mistakes (e.g., missing semicolon, unclosed quotes, extra parentheses).  
   - The compiler detects it and prevents execution until fixed.  

2. **Fatal Error**:-  
   - Happens when PHP understands the code but encounters an undefined function or serious issue.  
   - Causes the script to stop running immediately.  

3. **Warning Error**:-  
   - Occurs when a problem is encountered (e.g., missing file) but does not stop execution.  
   - Should not be ignored as it may cause issues later.

> echo vs print?

PHP echo and print are two most language constructs used for output data on the screen. 
| echo | print |
|------|--------|
| we can pass multiple arguments separated by commas|	In Print, we cannot pass multiple arguments|
|It displays the outputs of one or more strings separated by commas|	Through the Print statement, we can only show the strings|
|Echo can be used with or without parentheses	|Print can also be used with or without parentheses|
|This statement is fast as compared to the print statement|	It is slow as compared to the echo statement|
|It does not return any value|	It always returns the integer value that is 1 |

> Case Sensitivity in PHP

PHP retrieves names based on their defined case sensitivity. Using the correct case is a common best practice.

- Case-Sensitive: Variables, object properties, array indexes, constants (PHP 8.0+), and class constants.
- Case-Insensitive: Functions, class names, methods, interfaces, traits, enumerations, keywords, magic methods/constants, and namespaces.

> programming language vs scripting language?

|Scripting Language	| Programming Language  |
|-------|-----|
| A scripting language is a language that uses a naive method to bring codes to a runtime environment|	A Programming language is a language which is used by humans to navigate their communication with computers|
|	These are made for a particular runtime environment|Programming languages are of three types :- low-level Programming language, Middle-level Programming language, High-level Programming language|
|	They are used to create dynamic web applications|	Programming languages are used to write computer programs|
|	Scripting languages contain different libraries	|They are high-speed languages  |
|These languages requires a host|	These languages are self executable|
|	Do not create a .exe file|	These generate .exe files|
|It is less code intensive when compared with programming language|	It is code intensive|
|	It does not create any binary files|	It does creates binary files|
|	It is easy for the beginner to write and understand the code|	It is difficult for the beginner to write and understand the code|
|	It is run inside another program|	It is independently run|
