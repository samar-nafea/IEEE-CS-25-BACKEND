> what is PHP?

PHP is a server-side scripting language created primarily for web development but it is also used as a general-purpose programming language. Unlike client-side languages like JavaScript, which are executed on the user’s browser, PHP scripts run on the server. The results are then sent to the client’s web browser as plain HTML.
