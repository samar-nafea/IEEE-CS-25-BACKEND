>What is RDBMS?

A collection of information that organizes data in predefined relationships where data is stored in one or more tables (or "relations") of columns and rows, making it easy to see and understand how different data structures relate to each other. 
An RDBMS includes functions that maintain the security, accuracy, integrity and consistency of the data.
It's also the basis for modern database systems like MySQL.

>RDBMS VS DBMS?


1. **Data Storage** – DBMS stores data as files, while RDBMS organizes it in tables with rows and columns.  

2. **Data Access** – DBMS requires accessing data individually, whereas RDBMS allows multiple data elements to be retrieved at once.  

3. **Data Relationships** – DBMS does not establish relationships between data, but RDBMS connects tables using keys.  

4. **Normalization** – DBMS does not support normalization, leading to data duplication, while RDBMS uses normalization to reduce redundancy.  

5. **Data Structure** – DBMS uses hierarchical or navigational models, while RDBMS follows a structured table format.  

6. **Data Handling** – DBMS is suitable for small data storage, whereas RDBMS efficiently handles large datasets.  

7. **Data Redundancy** – DBMS allows redundant data, while RDBMS minimizes redundancy using keys and indexes.  

8. **Usage** – DBMS is used for simple applications, while RDBMS is preferred for complex, large-scale systems.  

9. **Security** – DBMS has basic security, while RDBMS provides advanced access control and protection.  

10. **User Support** – DBMS is usually single-user, while RDBMS supports multiple users.  

11. **Speed** – DBMS fetches data slower, while RDBMS retrieves it faster using indexing.    

12. **Examples** – DBMS: XML, Windows Registry, FoxPro. RDBMS: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle.

> Naming conventions
In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.

###In MySQL:
-Table name in Singular and Lower Case
-Field Names be short names , easy and understandable
