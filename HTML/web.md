> Web servers?

A web server is both software and hardware that uses HTTP and other protocols to respond to client requests on the web. Its main role is to display website content, including text, images, videos, and applications, by storing, processing, and delivering webpages. Web servers are essential for web hosting.  

The hardware is a computer connected to the internet that stores web server software and website files like HTML documents, images, and JavaScript files. It includes components such as a processor, RAM, storage, and network interface cards.  

Web server software controls access to hosted files and ensures website content is displayed on user devices. It works with domain names and supports multiple domains on one server. Besides HTTP, some web servers support SMTP for email and FTP for file transfer and storage.
